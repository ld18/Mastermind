<b>Mastermind</b> <br>
This repository contains a python program which let you or a non human user play the game Mastermind on the console.<br>
It provides a flexible gamesetup which expands the traditional setting, in term of number of colors and length of master combination. <br>
For the non human player you can select between some different level of artificial intelligence. Starting with a totally random guessing player to a constraint satisfaction problem solving player. The player selection is done inside the \_\_init__ function of [GameCoordinator](https://github.com/ld18/Mastermind/blob/master/GameCoordinator.py).<br><br>
